 Application Name: 
 
 Point of Sale Application

 Innovative Idea: 

 Our application will provide a smooth checkout experience for a store.
 Our application relates to other Point of Sale Applications because it will allow the user to ring up items, select a payment method, and if cash is given, it will show the exact amount of change to return. Our application will also allow the user to add as many items to the store database by providing an item number/ barcode, item name, price, and tax or no tax.  
 Our application will differ from other retail POS systems as our application will have an option for the customer to enter a phone #, so we can track the data from the transaction history for that customer.

 Data: 

 One form of data that our application will support will be a transaction history record associated with each user account that contains information about all of their past purchases, including what items they purchased, the dates at which they purchased them, and how much money the transaction was. This data will be used as a reference for users to look back at their transaction history, as well as to help detect and prevent fraudulent activity on their accounts. Our application will also support a shopping cart that displays all the items that a user has checked out but not yet purchased. This feature will enable users to select items to be placed in their personalized cart so that they can examine them at a later point in time. This is a convenience of online shopping built into our web-application. Our application will also support an online POS system that will ease the process of making online payments, and this feature will require us to store codes associated with each item on our web application. This data will be available to our users to help them identify products. Another form of data that our application will support will be a detailed but succinct descrition of all our products to provide customers with all the relevant information that they need before making a purchase. Our application will also display reviews and comments for each product, as well as answers to commonly asked questions.

 Functionality: 

 One functionality that our application will support will be to add items to a personalized shopping cart to be viewed at a later point in time. Users will be able to browse our items and should they find something interesting that they wish to look at more closely, they will be able to click on that item and subseqently on the top right corner of the page, an "add to shopping cart" button will appear. They can then click this button to add the item to their shopping cart. The shopping cart will be easily navigable from the home page and can be viewed at any time. Another functionality that our application will support will be to make an electronic purchase. Users will have the option to directly purchase an item a bypass the shopping cart. This will involve choosing a method of payment and inputting their information. Users will also have the option to get fast shipping at a small, additional cost. Our application will have the option to save payment credentials to make it easier for future payments. Another functionality our application will support will be to checkout items using their unique code identifier as part of a POS system that we plan to create. Each item will have associated with it a code identifier. Users can navigate to the checkout page directly and checkout items by their tag. Another functionality our application will support will be to write a review on our website for a particular product after they purchased it. This involves going to the page associated with an item, and clicking on the "add a review" button, where the user will be prompted to write a review. Users also have the ability to ask questions on this page which may be directed to the product owners.
